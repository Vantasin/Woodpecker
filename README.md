## 🧰 Prerequisites

* Docker Engine
* Docker Compose V2
* Git
* (Optional) ZFS on Linux for dataset management

> ⚠️ **Note:** These instructions assume your ZFS pool is named `tank`. If your pool has a different name (e.g., `rpool`, `zdata`, etc.), replace `tank` in all paths and commands with your actual pool name.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Create the stack directory and clone the repository**

   If using ZFS:
   ```bash
   sudo zfs create -p tank/docker/compose/Woodpecker
   cd /tank/docker/compose/Woodpecker
   sudo git clone https://github.com/Vantasin/Woodpecker.git .
   ```

   If using standard directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/docker/compose/Woodpecker
   cd ~/docker/compose/Woodpecker
   git clone https://github.com/Vantasin/Woodpecker.git .
   ```

2. **Create the runtime data directory** (optional)

   If using ZFS:
   ```bash
   sudo zfs create -p tank/docker/data/Woodpecker
   ```

   If using standard directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/docker/data/Woodpecker
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Copy and modify the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   sudo cp env.example .env
   sudo nano .env
   sudo chmod 600 .env
   ```

   > **Note:** Be sure to update the `WOODPECKER_HOST`, `WOODPECKER_ADMIN`, `WOODPECKER_GITEA_URL`, `WOODPECKER_GITEA_CLIENT`, `WOODPECKER_GITEA_SECRET`, `WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET` and if necessary the `WOODPECKER_SERVER_VOLUME`.

     - Create the `WOODPECKER_HOST` using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://github.com/Vantasin/Nginx-Proxy-Manager.git) as a reverse proxy for HTTPS certificates via Let's Encrypt.

     - The `WOODPECKER_ADMIN` is/are the Gitea username(s) allowed as admin.

     - The `WOODPECKER_GITEA_URL` is the URL used for your Gitea Instance, as such Woodpecker depends on Gitea.

     - You can generate the `WOODPECKER_GITEA_CLIENT` & `WOODPECKER_GITEA_SECRET` by visiting (in Gitea) Settings -> Applications -> Manage OAuth2 applications.

     - The `WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET` is a random user generated password of your choice, avoid special characters and symbols.

4. **Start Woodpecker**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## 🌐 Accessing Woodpecker Web UI

Once deployed, access Woodpecker using:

- **Web Interface (HTTP):** `http://localhost:8002` or replace `localhost` with your server’s IP address.  
- **Login:** You'll see a `Login with Gitea` button.
> **Note:** If you don’t see the `Login with Gitea` button, check that your `.env` file.
